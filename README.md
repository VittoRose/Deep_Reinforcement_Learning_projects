# Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_projects
 
A collection of Deep Reinforcement Learning project used to understand the machine learning approach in control theory. 
All of the work is part of my master thesis in Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) that will be available soon on my GitHub profile.

## Deep Q-Network project
I created 2 project using DQN algorithm:
- Inversed pendulum balancing
- Flappy bird
Both projects are implemented without external dependencies and serve as learning exercises for understanding the DQN approach. These foundational projects are part of my journey toward implementing more advanced DRL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which will be used in my master's thesis.

## Proximal Policy Optimization
The *GYM_test_PPO* folder contains a PPO implementation capable of solving multiple environments from the Gymnasium library. The training data for all tested environments can be monitored using TensorBoard, allowing detailed performance tracking.
